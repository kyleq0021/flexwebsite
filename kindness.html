          <p class="textColumn">Fans of Harry will already know that 'TPWK' is an acronym which stands for 'Treat People With Kindness'. It's a phrase that Harry has used for years now. During his first solo world tour, Harry sold merch with the phrase on them to raise money for local charities.</p>
          <p class="textColumn">You can still buy 'Treat People With Kindness' t-shirts from his store today. Harry often tweets the phrase from his account too. It's a common phrase but in recent years, it's become Harry's life mantra.</p>

          <p>In an October 2019 article, Capital FM noted that the slogan now holds major significance to Styles' fanbase: The slogan on his merchandise has been widely adopted by fans as a symbol for love, kindness and acceptance. </p>
          <p>I told Jeff, I would love to someday write a song called ‘Treat People With Kindness.’ And he was like, ‘Why don’t you just do it?’ It made me uncomfortable at first, because I wasn’t sure what it was—but then I wanted to lean into that. I feel like that song opened something that’s been in my core. – Harry Styles, via Rolling Stone </p>
